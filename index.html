                    Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.

<br><br>I am a student of Green University Of Bangladesh Dept of CSE. There is a purpose to choose this subject. I have a lot of interest in programming.I had not much conectivity with computer. When i get it, I always try to learn how it works.I learnt Photoshop,Illustrator,html,css,c.

<br><br>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.Always i am trying to develope myself by learning new things.I have some softskills about graphoc design, web design and also digital marketing. It gives me pleasure to learn new things.  

<br><br>This is a brief introduction of myself.

                Hello,I can make a responsive website using HTML & CSS.Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

            <p>
                I can make logo,banner design,flyer,broucher etc using photoshop and illustrator.Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator both work with images, but they are very different applications. The main differences between Photoshop and Illustrator are the types of files each program works with and whether you’re editing graphics or photos.

            <p>
                I am also a digital marketer.Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with potential customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not only email, social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a marketing channel.

Essentially, if a marketing campaign involves digital communication, it's digital marketing.
